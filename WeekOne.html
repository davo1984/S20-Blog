   <H3>Week One</H3>
   <P>This first week passed in a blur of information that left me feeling like I was drinking 
      from a firehose.  Working through the GitHub tutorials felt like all of my concentration 
      was solely focused on getting through the tutorial rather than actually learning the 
      material.   I plan on doing a more in-depth review as time permits.   Also just trying to 
      figure out what format to turn in this work is unsettling.   I am looking forward in 
      eagar anticipation to the coming week. 
   </P>
