   <H3>Week One</H3>
   <P>This first week passed in a blur of information that left me feeling like I was drinking from a firehose.  Working through the GitHub tutorials felt like all of my concentration was solely focused on getting through the tutorial rather than actually learning the material.   My plan on doing a more indepth review as time permits.   Also just trying to figure out what format to turn in this work is unsettling.   I am looking forward in eagar anticipation to the coming week. </P>
